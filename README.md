# Three ways to perform EOF analysis in MATLAB

Here we show three ways to perform EOF analysis using MATLAB codes.


## Data
In this example, we use monthly 3D sst anomaly data during 1979-2020 to perform the EOF analysis. Data are stored as the `ssta` mat file, containing lon, lat, and 91*31*504 sst anomaly data.


## 1. Direct calculation based on EOF essence
